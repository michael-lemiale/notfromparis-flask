                French-American electronic duo <strong>NOT FROM PARIS</strong> is the collaboration
                of two brothers, Michael & Sebastian Lemiale.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                The project was born in Austin, TX where the two reconnected, later embarking on a journey
                to blend their multi-instrumentalist roots with the vast array of sound manipulation capabilities
                offered by digital music production.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                The result is a bold, cinematronic soundscape featuring the epic scale of a film score and their
                colossal, wall of sound synthesizers.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Their first <strong>NOT FROM PARIS</strong> single "crying out" 
                is the genesis of their unique sound. They invite you to join them as they venture deeper 
                into their cinematronic universe.
